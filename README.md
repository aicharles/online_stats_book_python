# [Onlinestatsbook.com](Onlinestatsbook.com) with Python  
____

Onlinestatsbook.com is an infamous free online textbook for statistics. It's long past time someone created Jupyter notebooks based on it.  

_Notes & Q_

*  This repo contains Jupiter notebooks for each chapter of the infamous [onlinestatsbook.com](onlinestatsbook.com) (starting with chapter 3 because everything before that is too simple).  There's a separate folder containing notebooks for some of the case studies that is forthcoming.  

*  _Why did I do/am I doing this?_  Well, I thought it would be good practice and help drive home concepts home and I thought it might be useful to someone out there in the world.  

*  _How did I choose what formulas or exercises to include?_  Simple: if I deemed that it lent itself to coding and analyzing in python, I included it.  

*  If I did something wrong (likely!) please let me know and I will fix it.
