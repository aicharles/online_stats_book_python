# [Onlinestatbook.com](http://www.onlinestatbook.com) with Python  
______

###  [Onlinestatbook.com] (http://www.onlinestatbook.com) is an infamous free online textbook for statistics. This repo contains Jupyter notebooks based on it using Python.  

##  _Notes & Q_

*  The repo starts with chapter 3 because everything before that is too basic to bother with coding.  

*  Exercises at the end of each chapter contain exercises concerning certain case studies.   Each case study has its own Jupiter notebook.  To be clear, if you are looking for the work for a particular question related to a case study, check the Jupiter notebook for that case study.  

*  **_Why did I do/am I doing this?_**  Well, I thought it would be good practice and help drive home concepts home and I thought it might be useful to someone out there in the world.  

*  **_How did I choose what formulas or exercises to include?_**  Simple: if I deemed that it lent itself to coding and analyzing in python, I included it.  

*  **If I did something wrong (likely!) please let me know and I will fix it.**
