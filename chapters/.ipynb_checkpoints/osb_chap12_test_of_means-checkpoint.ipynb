    "Many experiments are designed to compare more than two conditions. An obvious way to proceed would be to do a t test of the difference between each group mean and each of the other group means. The problem with this approach is that if you did this analysis, you would have six chances to make a Type I error. The more means that are compared, the more the Type I error rate is inflated. Figure 1 shows the number of possible comparisons between pairs of means (pairwise comparisons) as a function of the number of means. \n",

    "The probability of a type I error rate is high even for a small number of means.  The Type I error rate can be controlled using a test called the **Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test or Tukey HSD** for short. The Tukey HSD is based on a variation of the t distribution that takes into account the number of means being compared. This distribution is called the **studentized range distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  The assumptions of the Tukey test are essentially the same as for an independent-groups t test: normality, homogeneity of variance, and independent observations. The test is quite robust to violations of normality. Violating homogeneity of variance can be more problematical than in the two-sample case since the MSE is based on data from all groups. The assumption of independence of observations is important and should not be violated.\n",
