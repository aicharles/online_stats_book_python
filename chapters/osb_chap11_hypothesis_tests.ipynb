    "A low probability value casts doubt on the null hypothesis. How low must the probability value be in order to conclude that the null hypothesis is false? t is conventional to conclude the null hypothesis is false if the probability value is less than 0.05.  to be more conservative, go for .01.  When a researcher concludes that the null hypothesis is false, the researcher is said to have rejected the null hypothesis.  The probability value below which the null hypothesis is rejected is called the α (alpha) level or simply α. It is also called the significance level.  When the null hypothesis is rejected, the effect is said to be statistically significant. It is very important to keep in mind that statistical significance means only that the null hypothesis of exactly no effect is rejected; it does not mean that the effect is important, which is what \"significant\" usually means. When an effect is significant, you can have confidence the effect is not exactly zero. Finding that an effect is significant does not tell you about how large or important the effect is.\n",
    "\n",
    "two approaches common approaches to conducting significance tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In one (favored by R. Fisher), a significance test is conducted and the probability value reflects the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. If the probability is below 0.01, the data provide strong evidence that the null hypothesis is false. If the probability value is below 0.05 but larger than 0.01, then the null hypothesis is typically rejected, but not with as much confidence as it would be if the probability value were below 0.01. Probability values between 0.05 and 0.10 provide weak evidence against the null hypothesis and, by convention, are not considered low enough to justify rejecting it. Higher probabilities provide less evidence that the null hypothesis is false.  this approach is more suitable for scientific research and what we focus on\n",
    "\n",
    "* The alternative approach (favored by the statisticians Neyman and Pearson) is to specify an α level before analyzing the data. If the data analysis results in a probability value below the α level, then the null hypothesis is rejected; if it is not, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. According to this perspective, if a result is significant, then it does not matter how significant it is. Moreover, if it is not significant, then it does not matter how close to being significant it is. Therefore, if the 0.05 level is being used, then probability values of 0.049 and 0.001 are treated identically. This approach is more suitable for applications in which a yes/no decision must be made for example a machine malfunction and whether it needs to be taken off the line.\n",

An experiment is conducted and vegetarians do have more of the vitamin, but the difference is not significant. The probability value is 0.13. Should the experimenter's confidence in the theory increase, decrease, or stay the same?\n",
