    "### Section 1: \"Introduction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major applications of statistics is estimating **population parameters** from **sample statistics**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Point estimates** are statistics that are a single value.  Point estimates are usually supplemented by interval estimates called confidence intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: \"Degrees of Freedom\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom (df) of an estimate is the number of independent pieces of information on which the estimate is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://onlinestatbook.com/2/estimation/df.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: \"Characteristics of Estimators\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias**\n",
    "A statistic is biased if the long-term average value of the statistic is not the parameter it is estimating. More formally, a statistic is biased if the mean of the sampling distribution of the statistic is not equal to the parameter. The mean of the sampling distribution of a statistic is sometimes referred to as the expected value of the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling Variability**\n",
    "The sampling variability of a statistic refers to how much the statistic varies from sample to sample and is usually measured by its standard error ; the smaller the standard error, the less the sampling variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 8: \"Confidence Interval on the Mean\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you compute the 95% confidence interval for the mean with the following formula **when we know the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean (which never happens)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower limit = M - Z.95σM\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper limit = M + Z.95σM\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the t distribution rather than the normal distribution when the variance is not known and has to be estimated from sample data. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, with smaller sample sizes, the t distribution is leptokurtic, which means it has relatively more scores in its tails than does the normal distribution. As a result, you have to extend farther from the mean to contain a given proportion of the area. Recall that with a normal distribution, with a normal distribution, 95% of the distribution is within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Using the t distribution, if you have a sample size of only 5, 95% of the area is within 2.78 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, the standard error of the mean would be multiplied by 2.78 rather than 1.96.\n",

You sample N values and compute the sample mean (M) and estimate the standard error of the mean (σM) with sM.

Gosset who determined the distribution of a mean divided by an estimate of its standard error. This distribution is called the Student's t distribution or sometimes just the t distribution. \n",
